## Statement

In my new body of work it is the materiality that creates the message and excites and inspires. 

The process in itself is significant. While the playfulness and experience of pulling, breaking, fragmenting, photographing and printing fuels my imagination, the making itself is thought through and realised with skill and passion. I endeavour to take the material to new places, stretching them and myself. 

All materials are sourced from distinctly different places. Contextualizing or juxtaposing them allow to disclose their hidden narrative.
