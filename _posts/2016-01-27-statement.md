## Statement

The inner
message that speaks from a work of art is more important to me than the medium
and technique chosen. However, in my new body of work it is the materiality
that creates the message and excites and inspires. I play, explore and respond.
I extract what is there and take the material to new places, stretching them
and myself.

This often leads to
surprising and exciting results. 

The
process in itself is significant. While the playfulness and experience of
pulling, breaking, fragmenting, photographing and printing fuels my
imagination, the making itself is thought through and realised with skill and
passion. 

All
materials are sourced from distinctly different places. Contextualizing or
juxtaposing them allow to disclose their hidden narrative.
