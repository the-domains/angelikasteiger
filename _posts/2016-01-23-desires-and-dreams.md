**Desires and Dreams**

Manifestations of our desires are often the
subject matter for many of our dreams. A cherished aspiration, ambition, or
ideal can be made to seem very 'real' within our dreams. Artists throughout the
ages have been deeply interested in interpreting dreams as conduits for
unspoken feelings and desires. Art initiated by a desire or a dream stems from
an association between images, real or imagined, their meaning within the mind,
and ultimately their interpretation through the hand of the artist. In this
group exhibition ten artists come together to show the reinforcing power of art
as an emotional yet personal relationship. The work spans a wide variety of
techniques, concepts, and subject matter through painting, sculpture and more,
but all embody an element of that artist's desires and dreams. Participating
artists are 

___Maureen Banfield Hamlin, Elaine Coles, Janet Curley Cannon, Gill
Hawkins, Jillian McLaren, Rosemary Miller, Forbes Moores, Patricia Sharman,
Angelika Steiger __and Markus Wanger_
